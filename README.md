# Urban-Traffic-Managment-System
Urban traffic congestion needs adaptive control. This study uses DRL with V2I data where signals act as agents in a MADRL system. Real-time updates improve flow, giving 66% higher throughput, 59% shorter queues, 43% faster travel, and 33% less fuel use, making it ideal for smart cities.
